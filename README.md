This is a playground for doing the [Fly.io Distributed Systems
Challenge](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) and learning Rust at the same time! 

You can find the different nodes from the challenge in `src/bin` and a
single-file implementation of a library for building a Maelstrom-compatible node
in `src/maelstrom.rs`.

This is primary a learning project but perhaps is useful for others! 🎁
